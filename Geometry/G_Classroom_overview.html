  <h1>üìò Geometry ‚Äì Classroom Overview</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üìÇ Materials &amp; Organization</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Composition Notebook</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Main textbook + record. Scrapbook style.</li>
          <li>Glue/tape in ref pages, notes, examples, reflections.</li>
          <li>Weekly journal prompts go here ‚Äî for conceptual thinking + personal connection.</li>
          <li>Modules separated with <strong>mini folders</strong> as dividers.</li>
          <li>Sequence: start with blank notebook ‚Üí add mini folders at module start ‚Üí tape in handouts/ref pages inside notebook.</li>
          <li>Dictionary half-sheets for vocabulary are taped in as the module progresses, and mini-folders divide both modules and serve as archive of finished work.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mini Folders</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>One per module; start of module goes here.</li>
          <li>Hold finished work not taped in (activities, assessments, big handouts).</li>
          <li>Portfolio inside notebook for easy review.</li>
          <li>Flow: classroom Manila folder (unfinished) ‚Üí mini folder (finished) ‚Üí tape in notebook.</li>
          <li>Finished mini folder work usually archival; clarify if grading later needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Classroom Manila Folder</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Kept in classroom for unfinished work, extra handouts, loose papers waiting placement.</li>
          <li>Work moves from Manila folder ‚Üí mini folder ‚Üí notebook (if taped).</li>
          <li>Clear routine to avoid pile-up/confusion; remind students regularly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üåÄ Systems &amp; Flow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Meeting Pattern</strong>: Class Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri; no Wed.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lesson Rhythm</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Start mostly with visual/hands-on/discovery activities, not mini-lessons.</li>
          <li>Mini-lessons only to formalize or introduce tools after discovery.</li>
          <li>Whole-class talk links observations to precise terms, definitions, theorems.</li>
          <li>Guided/independent notebook work to record key points/examples.</li>
          <li>Warm-ups taped at start of notebook page; reflections last 5 min or next class start if needed; both tied to same day‚Äôs page.</li>
          <li>From Thursday Week 1 on, daily color-coded warm-up/reflection sheets: warm-ups taped top of page; reflections paper-clipped until used.</li>
          <li>Vocab/definitions introduced via class talk, kept on <strong>module-specific ref pages</strong>. Early M1: formal defs for <strong>point</strong>, <strong>line</strong>, <strong>plane</strong> taped in dictionary. Vocabulary introduced is expanded to include polygon types, angle relationships introduced informally in Module 0, and meta-vocab emphasis. Angle relationship vocabulary is seeded informally in Module 0 and formalized in Module 1. This vocabulary work bridges directly into the Module 1 3D Tile Project, where symmetry and transformation language is essential for both design planning and proof writing.</li>
          <li><strong>Flashcard Factory (FF)</strong>: periodic vocab reinforcement with symbols + imagery. Use FF for review but don‚Äôt overload; integrate with notebook ref pages. Typical frequency: about once per module or at major vocabulary milestones, allowing for both creation and refinement sessions.</li>
          <li>Post 2‚Äì3 concise ‚ÄúSuccess Criteria‚Äù on flagged days to guide learning, similar to Algebra 1‚Äôs ClassroomScreen usage note.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Skill Points (SP)</strong>: daily chances embedded in warm-ups, group work, creative tasks; separate from Skill Gates and grade.</li>
      <li>Students self-submit SP-worthy work Fridays via Google Form + photo; Mondays show examples + award stamps for standout pages.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Project-Based Emphasis</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Many modules end with mini project/poster (e.g. Indirect Measurement Poster in Symmetry & Similarity, Trig in Action in Right Triangle Trig).</li>
          <li>Projects done in class with checkpoints; best examples displayed.</li>
          <li>SP awarded for creativity, precision, collaboration on projects.</li>
          <li>Discovery construction explorations (‚ÄúMake Your Own / Make Someone Else‚Äôs‚Äù) treated as mini-projects to build precision, labeling, construction fluency‚Äîeven if not formally graded.</li>
          <li>These early constructions double as mini-projects + SP opportunities, building toward IM 1.9 challenge and 3D Tile Project.</li>
          <li>M1‚Äôs big project: 3D-Printed Tile, introduced in final weeks of module; early precision and construction work feeds into project readiness.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Notebook as Textbook</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Students build personal record of definitions, theorems, examples, reflections.</li>
          <li>Tape-in handouts, foldables, visuals reinforce concepts.</li>
          <li>Journal prompts for metacognition (e.g. ‚ÄúWhere have you seen this shape or relationship in real life?‚Äù).</li>
          <li>Keep notebook organized and sequential for easy review and grading.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assessment Structure</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Practice</strong>: Ungraded skill builders (DeltaMath, classwork, puzzles). Assigned as needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Skill Gates</strong>: short fluency checks in module sequence to confirm readiness + mark skills as ‚Äúexpected from here on.‚Äù Term ‚ÄúSkill Gates‚Äù used consistently.</li>

            Example Wk2: naming lines/segments/rays, planes, diagram marks (‚à•, ‚üÇ, ‚âÖ) via 10-12 item DeltaMath mini-quiz with auto review + retakes.
          </li>
          <li>Retakes only on missed parts; done during office hours through Wed end of day (Mon/Tue OH, Mon night block, Wed block). Can raise score to 100%. Managed in DeltaMath.</li>
          <li>Note: Weekly DeltaMath often covers more than Skill Gates‚Äîso DM ‚â† just gates.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Culminating tasks/projects to show mastery, with feedback time before final turn-in.</li>
          <li><strong>Skill Points (SP)</strong>: motivation currency for design, creativity, precision, collaboration, reflection. Separate from Skill Gates and grade.</li>
          <li><strong>DeltaMath loop</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Weekly sets launched early (usually Mon/Tue), due Fridays 11 PM.</li>
              <li>Skill Gates embedded in DM sets.</li>
              <li>Missed objectives auto trigger review sets.</li>
              <li>Retakes after completion, during office hours until Wed end of day.</li>
              <li>Small in-class work blocks for DM on Fri or Thu.</li>
              <li>Note: Weekly DM sets often go beyond Skill Gates.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spirals &amp; Connections</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Concepts recur across modules (similarity shows up in circles, trig resurfaces in arc length modeling).</li>
          <li>Algebra 1 skills (coordinate geometry, solving equations, proportional reasoning) intentionally threaded in for SAT + beyond.</li>
          <li>Construction skills repeat (bisectors in triangles, tangent/normal in circles).</li>
          <li><strong>Build:</strong> Patterns, Precision, and Reasoning ‚Üí <strong>Move:</strong> Transformations, Intersections, and Logic ‚Üí <strong>Prove:</strong> Congruence, Connections, and Argument.</li>
          <li>Consider tracking spiral connections explicitly in classroom screen (e.g. running ‚ÄúWhere we‚Äôve seen this before‚Äù list) to support review.</li>
          <li>Includes explicit definition precision work from Week 3 and coordinate geometry connections from Week 4.</li>
          <li>Weekly DeltaMath supports and reinforces different focus skills (naming, construction reading, estimation, etc.).</li>
          <li>Construction applications also connect to the idea of visual reasoning as a universal mathematical language seen across cultures.</li>
          <li>First formal proof exposure occurs in Module 1, after transformation and angle relationship foundations are built; proof readiness is signaled through a Skill Gate on transformations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Role Assignment in Group Work</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Roles rotate regularly to keep balance. Final roles set after first weeks once table dynamics clear.</li>
          <li>Use role sheets or reminders to keep rotations smooth.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scoreboard &amp; Group Rewards</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Visible Classroom Screen scoreboard runs Tuesday each week, tracking group points throughout the week.</li>
          <li>Friday: Winning group receives bonus Skill Points and Treasure Box pick.</li>
          <li>Use scoreboard to motivate and track group progress weekly, with all groups receiving bonus points based on their ranking.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Calendar Considerations</strong>: Note schedule quirks such as Family Weekend, short weeks, and visitor days that impact pacing and require flexible planning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vocabulary Tracking</strong>: Dictionary format is half-sheet taped pages updated at key module points; vocabulary introduced in Module 0 is formalized there, and Module 1 adds preimage/image and rigid motions. Also includes non-dictionary emphasis on meta-vocab and informal terms introduced in class discussions and reinforced in deltamath and flashcard factory. Examples of meta-vocab include terms like adjacent, congruent, bisect, intersect, parallel, and perpendicular.
