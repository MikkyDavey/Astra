  <div class="section">
    <h2>üìÇ Materials &amp; Organization</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Composition Notebook</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Serves as the scrapbook-style textbook and primary record of learning.</li>
          <li>Students tape or glue in reference pages, class notes, worked examples, and project reflections.</li>
          <li>Weekly journal prompts are added here to encourage conceptual reflection and personal connection to the material.</li>
          <li>Divided into modules using <strong>mini folders</strong> as section dividers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mini Folders</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Placed at the start of each module.</li>
          <li>Used to store <strong>finished</strong> materials (activities, assessments, or large-format handouts) that are not taped directly into the notebook.</li>
          <li>Act as a portfolio space within the notebook, making it easy to review a module‚Äôs full body of work.</li>
          <li>Work flows: classroom folder (unfinished) ‚Üí mini folder (finished) ‚Üí notebook (final placement if taped in).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Classroom Manila Folder</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Stored in the classroom.</li>
          <li>Used for <strong>unfinished</strong> work, extra handouts, and loose items awaiting placement in the notebook or mini folder.</li>
          <li>Work flows: classroom folder (unfinished) ‚Üí mini folder (finished) ‚Üí notebook (final placement if taped in).</li>

    <h2>üåÄ Systems &amp; Flow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Lesson Rhythm</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Most lessons include:
            <ul>
              <li>Visual, hands-on, or investigative introduction to the concept.</li>
              <li>Whole-class discussion to connect student observations to formal definitions and theorems.</li>
              <li>Guided or independent notebook work to record key ideas and examples.</li>
              <li>Warm-up and reflection prompts are a standard part of most lessons, with warm-ups taped in at the start and reflections completed at the end or on the following day.</li>
              <li>From Thursday onward each week, students receive a daily color-coded warm-up/reflection handout at the start of class. Warm-ups are taped into the top of the day‚Äôs notebook page; reflection prompts are kept with a paperclip until used on a later day.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Vocabulary and definitions are introduced through guided class discussions and maintained on <strong>module-specific reference pages</strong> in the notebook.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Skill Points (SP)</strong> opportunities occur daily and are embedded into warm-ups, group work, and creative problem-solving tasks.</li>
      <li>Students self-select SP-worthy work via Google Form on Fridays and submit a photo. On Mondays, selected examples are shown, and stamps are awarded for notable pages. SP stamps are only for outstanding design, creativity, or problem-solving.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Project-Based Emphasis</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Many modules include a culminating mini project or poster (e.g., <em>Indirect Measurement Poster</em> in Symmetry &amp; Similarity, <em>Trig in Action</em> in Right Triangle Trigonometry).</li>
          <li>Projects are worked on in class with checkpoints, with top examples displayed at the end of the module.</li>
          <li>SP can also be awarded for creativity, precision, or collaboration in project work.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Notebook as a Textbook</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Students build a personalized record of definitions, theorems, examples, and reflections.</li>
          <li>Tape-in handouts, foldables, and visual organizers reinforce conceptual connections.</li>
          <li>Journal prompts encourage metacognition (e.g., ‚ÄúWhere have you seen this shape or relationship in the real world?‚Äù).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assessment Structure</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Practice</strong>: Ungraded, skill-building activities (DeltaMath, classwork, puzzles). Practice: daily or weekly as needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Skill Gates</strong>: Short, focused checks embedded within module progression to confirm procedural fluency.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Culminating performance tasks or projects to demonstrate mastery in context at module or sub-module culmination, with time for feedback before final submission.</li>
          <li>SP is not part of the grade but serves as a classroom engagement and motivation system, with stamps awarded for notable notebook pages or participation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spirals &amp; Connections</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Concepts recur across modules (e.g., similarity reappears in circles; triangle trigonometry resurfaces in modeling arc lengths).</li>
          <li>Skills from Algebra 1 (coordinate geometry, proportional reasoning) are intentionally threaded in to prepare for SAT and higher math.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Role Assignment in Group Work</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Group roles rotate regularly to balance collaboration. Roles will be finalized after initial weeks once natural table dynamics are observed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scoreboard &amp; Group Rewards</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A visible Classroom Screen scoreboard runs from Tuesday onward each week. On Fridays, all groups receive an SP boost, and the winning table gets a Treasure Box pick.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üîÑ Future Spiral Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarify the routine for moving work from Manila Folder ‚Üí Mini Folder ‚Üí Notebook to prevent pile-up or confusion.</li>
      <li>Standardize vocabulary reference page structure for easy cumulative review (possible table, Frayer model, or mind map).</li>
      <li>Ensure weekly journal prompts are explicitly tied to module spirals and concepts, not just as extra writing.</li>
      <li>Standardize project checkpoints, especially for measurement-based tasks, to prevent errors from carrying through.</li>
      <li>Double-check module calendar to ensure SAT-critical topics (coordinate circle equations, transformations) are explicitly included.</li>
      <li>Add explicit proof integration in the system‚Äîpossibly a dedicated notebook section or customizable flowchart template for student logic tracking.</li>
      <li>Clarify whether finished materials in mini folders will ever be graded later or remain purely archival.</li>
      <li>Decide whether spiral connections should be tracked explicitly in the notebook (e.g., a running ‚ÄúWhere we‚Äôve seen this before‚Äù list).</li>
      <li>Replace ‚ÄúSkill Checks‚Äù with ‚ÄúSkill Gates‚Äù in all relevant references.</li>
    </ul>
