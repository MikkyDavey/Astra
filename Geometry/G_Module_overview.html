  <h1>üìò Geometry Module Overview</h1>

  <h2>üì¶ Module 0 ‚Äì Build: Patterns, Precision, and Reasoning</h2>

  <h3>üéØ Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Module 0 establishes the foundations for the year during Weeks 1‚Äì5. Students build routines, tool skills, and diagram literacy, while developing precise vocabulary and habits for definition writing. The weeks focus on routines, vocabulary, angle measurement, and classic compass and straightedge constructions (including applications). Students connect midpoint using coordinate methods. The module culminates in IM 1.9, a real-world application challenge (celebration-style culminating task, light scoring emphasis), during Family Weekend, with group SP awards and celebration (shortened week with visitors; pacing adjusted for light, collaborative work). Emphasis is on building community, fluency with both physical and digital geometry tools, and micro-skills needed for later proof and transformation work.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Weeks 1‚Äì2: Routines, folder/notebook setup, seating, Skill Gates, DeltaMath intro, SP routines, discovery-based diagram exploration, formal vocabulary (point, line, plane, ray, segment, endpoints, coplanar, collinear, intersection, congruent, parallel, perpendicular, bisector, circle, center, radius), Flashcard Factory sessions.</em></li>
    <li><em>Weeks 2‚Äì3: Diagram labeling, vocabulary expansion, Make Your Own / Match Mine instruction writing, ‚ÄúWhat makes a good definition?‚Äù activities, collaborative vocabulary building.</em></li>
    <li><em>Weeks 3‚Äì4: Angle measurement and naming, classic compass/straightedge constructions (equilateral triangle, perpendicular bisector, angle bisector), diagram micro-skills.</em></li>
    <li><em>Week 4‚Äì5: Coordinate midpoint connection, IM 1.6 construction stations, consolidation of all skills, IM 1.9 performance challenge, Family Weekend, and group SP awards.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üìö Skills & Topics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Classroom, notebook, and SP routines; Skill Gates ‚Äî including daily tape-in structure, module dividers, dictionary half-sheets, weekly SP checks, and role rotation for group work.</li>
    <li>Diagram literacy: interpreting, labeling, and marking diagrams; naming conventions for points, lines, rays, segments, angles, triangles, and polygons; reading congruence (‚âÖ), parallel (‚à•), perpendicular (‚üÇ), right-angle squares, and other standard marks; naming polygons in vertex order; naming congruent objects in the same order.</li>
    <li>Vocabulary precision: formal definitions for core geometry terms (point, line, plane, ray, segment, endpoints, coplanar, collinear, intersection, congruent, parallel, perpendicular, bisector, circle, center, radius) and early shape vocabulary (polygon, triangle types, quadrilateral types, vertex, side, interior/exterior); introduction to regular polygon; adjacent/vertical angles, linear pair, complementary/supplementary, transversal, and angle position terms introduced for familiarity; meta-vocabulary (example/non-example, counterexample, classify/differentiate, necessary/sufficient, legal/illegal move, equidistant, constraint, assumption, precision).</li>
    <li>Definition writing: classify/differentiate method using examples and non-examples; collaborative drafting and peer testing; refining for necessary & sufficient conditions; adding polygon types as full dictionary entries (Week 4 warm-up).</li>
    <li>Instruction writing and reconstruction (Make Your Own / Match Mine): sequencing legal moves, diagram readability, peer reproduction; serves as prerequisite skill for construction sequences and transformation descriptions.</li>
    <li>Angle measurement and naming: correct vertex placement, baseline alignment, inside vs. outside scale; m‚à† notation; accuracy within ¬±2¬∞; reinforced via DeltaMath sets and estimation problems (within 10¬∞); practice with both physical and digital protractor tools.</li>
    <li>Compass/straightedge fluency: draw circles, equilateral triangles, perpendicular bisectors, angle bisectors, regular hexagons; copy angles; construct parallel through a point on a line; reinforced via DeltaMath sets with digital tools and solution guides; proper tool handling and labeled construction lines emphasized.</li>
    <li>Angle construction applications: design contexts (tiling, motifs) and mapping contexts (perpendicular bisector as set of equidistant points); link to real-world and cultural geometry; discussion of visual reasoning as a universal tool.</li>
    <li>Use of both physical and digital tools for constructions: compass, straightedge, pencils, DeltaMath interactive constructions; optional GeoGebra introduction.</li>
    <li>Coordinate midpoint connection: midpoint formula and segment partitioning; link to perpendicular bisector concept; notebook call-out linking midpoint ‚Üî equidistant ‚Üî perpendicular bisector.</li>
    <li>Gate-ready micro-skills: naming conventions, diagram interpretation, vocabulary use in justifications, coordinate midpoint calculation and interpretation; readiness checks via DeltaMath Skill Gates.</li>
    <li>SP routines and group recognition: peer coaching (green pen), visible revisions (color-swap), tidy tape-ins, SP highlights, table awards; equity through rotating group roles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Compass/straightedge fluency</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Constructions are a <em>thinking gym</em>, not a perfection test. The goal is exposure, geometric intuition, and recognizing when/why a construction solves a problem. Precision is encouraged but not required for mastery credit.</li>
  <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Each construction is completed twice‚Äîonce physically (compass/straightedge) and once digitally (DeltaMath) for a friction‚Äëfree guided run‚Äëthrough.</li>
  <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Draw circle (fixed center/radius), straightedge through two points, transfer radius, perpendicular bisector, angle bisector, equilateral triangle, regular hexagon, parallel through a point, perpendicular through a point, and copy an angle.</li>
  <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Revisited in collaborative challenges where groups apply constructions in context. Reasoning & application take precedence over flawless execution.</li>
  <li><strong>Classroom culture:</strong> Productive struggle is welcomed. Students compare approaches and explain purposes/logic; success ‚â† perfect compass control.</li>
  <li><strong>SP & Assessment:</strong> SP for persistence, clear labeling, and reasoning. Skill Gates check understanding of purposes and diagram reading rather than demanding perfect physical replication.</li>

  <p>
    Module 1 (Weeks 6‚Äì12) launches with rigid motions (transformations), intersecting lines and angle relationships (including vertical, adjacent, linear pair, and transversal relationships), and connections to coordinate algebra.

Formal proof writing is introduced, focusing on angle relationships and algebraic logic. The module culminates in a 3D Printed Tile Design project, synthesizing transformation and design thinking. Angle-type identification and algebraic angle puzzles live here and serve as the on‚Äëramp to formal angle proofs.

  <h2>üì¶ Module 3 ‚Äì Similarity in the Wild</h2>

  <h3>üéØ Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Module 3 focuses squarely on similarity and proportional reasoning (Weeks 17‚Äì19). Students formalize dilations, develop triangle similarity criteria (AA, SSS~, SAS~), and use parallel-line proportionality to solve for unknowns in geometric and real contexts. Indirect Measurement (mirror method) serves as the applied capstone. Transformation work appears only as quick warm‚Äëup reviews (e.g., Desmos Transformations Golf holes) since full transformations were mastered in Module 1.
