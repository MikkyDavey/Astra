  <h1>üìò Geometry Module Overview</h1>

  <h2>üì¶ Module 1: From Definitions to Design</h2>

  <h3>üéØ Overview</h3>
  <p>The first weeks focus on establishing classroom systems, tool fluency, and collaborative norms while working discovery-first. Students launch Geometry with Week 1 routines including folder creation, seating arrangements, classroom norms, and an introduction to Skill Gates (Skill Gates ‚Äì checks that students have the skills they need to continue; marks that those skills will be expected from then on), which are paired with automated Deltamath review and section retakes by Wednesday EOD. Warm-ups and reflections are combined on a single color-coded sheet starting Thursday of Week 1. This class often begins with discovery-based visual work rather than a mini-lesson first; students frequently explore and make sense of diagrams before formal definitions are taped into notebooks. In Week 1, students tape formal definitions for <em>point</em>, <em>line</em>, and <em>plane</em> into their vocabulary dictionary. Notebook setup follows the folder organization to support learning. Daily SP opportunities are embedded, with warm-up and reflection handouts introduced starting Thursday. The procedural flow aligns with classroom rhythm: warm-ups begin each session, reflections are taped in after activities, and Skill Gates are integrated throughout. DeltaMath is introduced early for both class Skill Gates and individualized review assignments generated from results. On Friday of Week 2, students add vocabulary terms including ray, line segment, endpoints, coplanar, collinear, intersection, congruent, parallel, perpendicular, bisector, circle (includes center), and radius. Students build precise language and tool fluency (compass, straightedge, dynamic geometry), learning how definitions drive construction, how markings carry meaning, and how careful diagramming supports later proof. Angle naming and measurement basics are introduced in Week 3. The module closes with a 3D Printing Design Challenge that synthesizes construction skills, transformation intuition, and measurement for print-ready design.</p>

  <p>Students develop congruence reasoning and learn to communicate arguments using flexible proof formats. Emphasis is on SSS, SAS, ASA/AAS (with HL as time allows), reading diagrams without assumption, and building proof maps (flowchart, narrative, annotated diagrams).

  </ul>

  <h2>üì¶ Module 5: Circles in Motion</h2>

  <h3>üéØ Overview</h3>
  <p>Circles become a conceptual and symbolic capstone for the course, drawing together constructions, proof habits, similarity, and trigonometry. Students investigate chords, arcs, central/inscribed angles, tangent lines, and the power of radian measure.
