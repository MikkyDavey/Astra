  <h1>üìò Geometry Module Overview</h1>

  <h2>üì¶ Module 0 ‚Äì Build: Patterns, Precision, and Reasoning</h2>

  <h3>üéØ Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Module 0 establishes the foundations for the year during Weeks 1‚Äì5. Students build routines, tool skills, and diagram literacy, while developing precise vocabulary and habits for definition writing. The weeks focus on routines, vocabulary, angle measurement, and classic compass and straightedge constructions (including applications). Students connect midpoint using coordinate methods. The module culminates in IM 1.9, a real-world application challenge (celebration-style culminating task, light scoring emphasis), during Family Weekend, with group SP awards and celebration (shortened week with visitors; pacing adjusted for light, collaborative work). Emphasis is on building community, fluency with both physical and digital geometry tools, and micro-skills needed for later proof and transformation work.
    <strong>Week 4 includes intentional time padding</strong> to absorb squeeze (assemblies, retakes, slowed constructions): quick wins to shift/trim include Flashcard Factory minutes, DeltaMath work time, or pacing the dictionary build across two days. Additionally, angle types (vertical, linear pair, complementary, supplementary) and triangle categories (scalene, isosceles, equilateral) are <em>formally defined in Week 3</em>, with special quadrilaterals added in Week 4 before Family Weekend.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Weeks 1‚Äì2: Routines, folder/notebook setup, seating, Skill Gates, DeltaMath intro, SP routines, discovery-based diagram exploration, formal vocabulary (point, line, plane, ray, segment, endpoints, coplanar, collinear, intersection, congruent, parallel, perpendicular, bisector, circle, center, radius), Flashcard Factory sessions.</em></li>
    <li><em>Weeks 2‚Äì3: Diagram labeling, vocabulary expansion, Make Your Own / Match Mine instruction writing, ‚ÄúWhat makes a good definition?‚Äù activities, collaborative vocabulary building.</em></li>
    <li><em>Weeks 3‚Äì4: Angle measurement and naming, classic compass/straightedge constructions (equilateral triangle, perpendicular bisector, angle bisector), diagram micro-skills. <strong>Week 4 functions as a buffer week</strong>‚Äîdictionary finishing, short DM work blocks, or a compact FF round can flex to protect core instruction. Angle <em>types and triangle categories are defined in Week 3</em>.</em></li>
    <li><em>Week 4‚Äì5: Coordinate midpoint connection, IM 1.6 construction stations, special quadrilateral definitions and hierarchy organizer, consolidation of all skills, IM 1.9 performance challenge, Family Weekend, and group SP awards.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>‚è±Ô∏è Pacing & Buffer (Week 4)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Built‚Äëin slack:</strong> Recover 10‚Äì20 minutes by shortening Flashcard Factory creation or splitting set/approve across two short passes; reclaim 10‚Äì15 minutes by moving DeltaMath practice to homework (keep a 2‚Äì3 minute launch/check‚Äëin in class).</li>
    <li><strong>Trim/shift levers:</strong> Pace dictionary builds across two days; defer low‚Äëstakes gallery walks; convert long debriefs to quick 3‚Äì2‚Äì1 written reflections.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not cut:</strong> Core compass skills (perpendicular bisector, angle bisector), the protractor micro‚Äëguide, and the coordinate midpoint connection‚Äîthese are prerequisites for Modules 1‚Äì2.</li>
    <li><strong>If still squeezed:</strong> Move one Flashcard Factory round to Week 5 Friday (visitor‚Äëfriendly) or fold it into bell‚Äëringer series (Mon/Tue) without losing the larger arc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üìö Skills & Topics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Classroom, notebook, and SP system routines: daily tape-in structure, module dividers, dictionary half-sheets, weekly SP checks, and group role rotation.</li>
    <li>Diagram literacy: interpreting, labeling, and marking geometric diagrams; naming conventions for points, lines, rays, segments, angles, triangles, and polygons; reading standard diagram marks (tick marks for congruent segments, arrows for ‚à•, right‚Äëangle squares for ‚üÇ, midpoint hash marks when provided).</li>
    <li>Vocabulary development: precise definitions for core geometry terms (point, line, plane, ray, segment, endpoints, coplanar, collinear, intersection, congruent, parallel, perpendicular, bisector, circle, center, radius), shape vocabulary (polygon, triangle types, quadrilaterals, vertex, side, interior/exterior, special quadrilaterals (trapezoid, kite, parallelogram, rectangle, rhombus, square)), and meta-vocabulary (example/non-example, counterexample, classify/differentiate, necessary/sufficient, legal/illegal move, equidistant, constraint, assumption, precision).</li>
    <li>Definition writing: using classify/differentiate with examples and non-examples, collaborative drafting, peer testing, and refining for necessary and sufficient conditions; writing clear dictionary entries for vocabulary and polygons.</li>
    <li>Instruction writing: sequencing legal diagram moves, writing and following precise instructions (Make Your Own / Match Mine), and reconstructing diagrams from written steps.</li>
    <li>Angle measurement: using protractors (physical and digital), correct naming (vertex placement, m‚à† notation), baseline alignment, inside/outside scale, accuracy within ¬±2¬∞, and estimation skills.</li>
    <li>Compass and straightedge constructions: constructing circles, equilateral triangles, perpendicular bisectors, angle bisectors, regular hexagons, copying angles, constructing parallels and perpendiculars through a point, and emphasizing labeled construction lines and tool handling.</li>
    <li>Applications of constructions: solving design and mapping problems (e.g., tiling, motifs, finding loci), and connecting perpendicular bisectors to equidistant points in real-world and cultural contexts.</li>
    <li>Using both physical and digital tools: compass, straightedge, pencils, DeltaMath interactive construction modules, and optional GeoGebra introduction.</li>
    <li>Coordinate midpoint connection: using the midpoint formula, segment partitioning, and linking midpoint to perpendicular bisector and equidistant concepts; integrating coordinate calculations into geometric reasoning.</li>
    <li>Readiness micro-skills: naming conventions, diagram interpretation, vocabulary use in justifications, coordinate midpoint calculation, and diagram-based reasoning; readiness checks via DeltaMath Skill Gates.</li>
    <li>SP system and group recognition: peer coaching (green pen), visible revisions (color-swap), organized tape-ins, SP highlights, table awards, and equity through rotating roles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß© DeltaMath & Skill Gates (Module 0)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DM #1 (Week 2):</strong> naming & diagram interpretation; angle measurement basics.</li>
    <li><strong>DM #2 (Week 3):</strong> angle measurement & naming; diagram marks; early constructions (digital walkthroughs).</li>
    <li><strong>DM #3 (Week 4):</strong> constructions (digital), polygon/triangle vocabulary; coordinate midpoint.</li>
    <li><strong>No DM in Week 1 or Week 5.</strong> Friday in‚Äëclass Skill Gates are short DM quizzes on the week‚Äôs gate skills; retakes via office hours by Wednesday EOD of the following week.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Compass/straightedge fluency</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Constructions are a <em>thinking gym</em>, not a perfection test. The goal is exposure, geometric intuition, and recognizing when/why a construction solves a problem. Precision is encouraged but not required for mastery credit.</li>
  <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Each construction is completed twice‚Äîonce physically (compass/straightedge) and once digitally (DeltaMath) for a friction‚Äëfree guided run‚Äëthrough.</li>
  <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Draw circle (fixed center/radius), straightedge through two points, transfer radius, perpendicular bisector, angle bisector, equilateral triangle, regular hexagon, parallel through a point, perpendicular through a point, and copy an angle.</li>
  <li><strong>Tracks:</strong> <em>Core</em> = circle, perpendicular bisector, angle bisector, equilateral/hexagon; <em>Stretch</em> = parallel/perpendicular through a point, copy an angle (graded for reasoning, not perfection).</li>
  <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Revisited in collaborative challenges where groups apply constructions in context. Reasoning & application take precedence over flawless execution.</li>
  <li><strong>Classroom culture:</strong> Productive struggle is welcomed. Students compare approaches and explain purposes/logic; success ‚â† perfect compass control.</li>
  <li><strong>SP & Assessment:</strong> SP for persistence, clear labeling, and reasoning. Skill Gates check understanding of purposes and diagram reading rather than demanding perfect physical replication.</li>

  <h2>üì¶ Module 5: Circles in Motion</h2>

  <h3>üéØ Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Circles become a conceptual and symbolic capstone, synthesizing constructions, proof habits, similarity, and trigonometry. Students investigate chords, arcs, central/inscribed angles, tangent lines, and radian measure. Connections to right triangles and similarity are explicit; understanding is demonstrated through problem solving and the culminating Circle Design Challenge. Include a short ‚ÄòFigure Out My Measurement‚Äô day (tangents) to surface right‚Äëtriangle structures.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Circle vocabulary/theorems early; scaffold chord/tangent investigations.</em></li>
    <li><em>Labs on radians, arc/sector calculations with manipulatives/technology.</em></li>
    <li><em>Circle Design Challenge: final project; allow multiple sessions for design/presentation.</em></li>
    <li><em>SP and DeltaMath review cycles reinforce key concepts.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üìö Skills & Topics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Circle vocabulary: radius, diameter, chord, secant, tangent, arc, sector, central angle, inscribed angle, cyclic quadrilateral, and related terms.</li>
    <li>Understanding and applying circle theorems: relationships between central and inscribed angles, arc measures, and properties of chords, tangents, and secants.</li>
    <li>Tangent and chord properties: identifying and proving properties involving tangents (e.g., tangent-radius perpendicularity, tangent-tangent segments), and chord relationships (e.g., perpendicular bisector, equal chords imply equal arcs).</li>
    <li>Radians: defining and converting between radians and degrees, and understanding radian as a measure of angle.</li>
    <li>Arc and sector calculations: computing arc length and sector area using both degree and radian measure.</li>
    <li>Connections to triangles: identifying and using right-triangle structures within circles (e.g., inscribed right triangles, tangent-radius relationships) and applying similarity and trigonometry in circle contexts.</li>
    <li>Proof and logic: constructing arguments and justifications using circle theorems, properties, and vocabulary.</li>
    <li>Project-based skills: designing and presenting a Circle Design Challenge that synthesizes circle concepts, constructions, and geometric reasoning.</li>
