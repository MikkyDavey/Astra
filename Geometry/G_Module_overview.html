  <h1>üìò Geometry Module Overview</h1>

  <h2>üì¶ Module 1: From Definitions to Design</h2>

  <h3>üéØ Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Module 1 is structured as a progression from routines and tool introduction, to diagram and instruction literacy, then vocabulary expansion and definition writing, followed by angle measurement and relationships, and finally constructions consolidation and midpoint review. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Week 1:</strong> Students set up folders and notebooks, learn seating and classroom routines, and are introduced to Skill Gates. DeltaMath is introduced with due dates noted in class rather than daily. Students engage in discovery-first diagram exploration and matching, and practice giving and following step-by-step instructions. Formal definitions for <em>point</em>, <em>line</em>, and <em>plane</em> are taped into vocabulary dictionaries. SP routines and a Friday group scoreboard celebration are established.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Week 2:</strong> Vocabulary is expanded (ray, line segment, endpoints, coplanar, collinear, intersection, congruent, parallel, perpendicular, bisector, circle, center, radius), with Flashcard Factory after each major vocab build. Students analyze and write precise instructions for constructions, practice diagram interpretation and labeling, and participate in ‚ÄúWhat makes a good definition?‚Äù activities using unsigned notecards. ‚ÄúMake Your Own‚Äù and ‚ÄúMatch Mine‚Äù tasks are used to foster precision and collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Week 3:</strong> Focus shifts to angle measurement, naming conventions, and angle relationships (vertical angles, parallel lines), with algebraic puzzles for practice. Students begin hands-on constructions: equilateral triangle (Friday anchor) and perpendicular bisector. Definition-writing circuits and diagram labeling continue to build reasoning and vocabulary.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Week 4:</strong> Students consolidate construction skills (perpendicular bisector, angle bisector), connect coordinate midpoint concepts using Math Medic before IM 1.6 stations, and review all skills in preparation for the performance assessment. Anchor activities include IM 1.6 Constructions Stations and Friday group SP awards.
  </p>
