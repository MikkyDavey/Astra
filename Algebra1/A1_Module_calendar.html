            <li>Negative sign with powers: -3^2 vs. (-3)^2</li>
            <li>Fraction bar precedence: 10 – 4 / 2 and 3 / 1/2</li>
            <li>Roots with multiplication: √4 × 9 vs. √(4 × 9)</li>
            <li>Implied multiplication vs. explicit: 1/2x vs. (1/2)·x</li>
          </ul>
          Groups rank the list from smallest to largest, then compare with a different group who got a different order and debate which conventions are correct. 
          Leave some disputes unresolved as a teaser for Tuesday’s formal discussion of order of operations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tuesday:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>5 min – Warm-up: simple mixed operations without parentheses</li>
        <li>15 min – Mini-lesson: Order of Operations (PEMDAS as a hierarchy, not just a list); connect to real number system work</li>
        <li>20 min – Guided practice: mixed operations and return to Monday's ambiguous hierarchy (integers, fractions, decimals)</li>
        <li>12 min – <strong>Mastery Gate 0C: Order of Operations (numeric) &amp; Evaluating simple expressions</strong> — short in‑class gate to confirm readiness for Thursday variables and Friday scavenger hunt.</li>
        <li>8 min – Start DeltaMath #3: Order of Operations &amp; Evaluating Expressions (due Friday); students below threshold get an auto‑assigned review + office hours invite.</li>
        <li><em>Reflection:</em> “Write one expression that could be misread and explain how you’d make it unambiguous.”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Thursday:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>5 min – Warm-up: If x = 3, which is greater: 2x + 5 or 2(x + 5)?</li>
        <li>15 min – Mini-lesson: Introducing variables as placeholders for numbers. Explain that variables are symbols (like x) that can stand for different values, and that they allow us to write rules and expressions that work for many numbers. Demonstrate evaluating expressions by substituting specific values for variables and show that variables follow the same arithmetic rules as numbers. Emphasize that sometimes expressions with variables cannot be simplified further unless we know the value of the variable.</li>
        <li>15 min – Practice: Evaluate expressions with given variable values and identify expressions that cannot be simplified without knowing the variable. Reinforce the idea that variables behave like numbers in arithmetic operations.</li>
        <li>10 min – Work time: continue DeltaMath #3 Order of Operations and practice evaluating expressions with variables and numbers.</li>
        <li>5 min – Exit check/reflection: How is evaluating an expression with a variable similar to and different from working with plain numbers?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Friday:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>5 min – Introduction: Explain the Order of Operations & Evaluating Expressions Scavenger Hunt. Review expectations, materials, and how to rotate through stations. Highlight how this activity will help prepare for future skills and assessments.</li>
        <li>40 min – Scavenger Hunt Stations: Students rotate through a series of stations, each featuring a different problem or puzzle related to order of operations and evaluating expressions (with and without variables). Encourage collaboration and discussion at each station. Teacher circulates to support and check for understanding.</li>
        <li>5 min – Wrap-up/Reflection: Gather students to share strategies, discuss the most challenging problems, and highlight key takeaways. Prompt reflection: “What’s one thing you’ll watch for when simplifying expressions?” Remind students to check that all their work is recorded in their notebooks.</li>
        <li><strong>SP options (Challenge):</strong> Hint Card (2 SP), Notes Peek – your own notebook, 30s (3 SP), Check‑One‑Step (1 SP). Optionally, fastest accurate path earns table +2 SP.</li>
        <li><strong>Absent students or those needing more time:</strong> May continue the scavenger hunt during office hours on Monday or Tuesday of Week 5; final due date for completion is Wednesday of Week 5.</li>
        <li><strong>Improving scores:</strong> Students may improve their Skill Check scores by completing a DeltaMath review assignment, then scheduling a retake after the review is complete.</li>
        <li>10 min – Logistics: DeltaMath due (10 PM), submit Weekly Notebook Check (Google Form), preview Week 5 (properties & simplifying expressions)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Additional Notes:</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Comparing & Ordering task serves as a conceptual bridge from magnitude sense to operation reasoning.</li>
        <li>Highlight the connection between number sense and correct order of operations.</li>
        <li>Use examples with both known values and variable placeholders to build flexibility.</li>
        <li>Reinforce notebook use: all warm-ups and reflections should be glued or written in.</li>

    <h2>Week 5: Properties of Real Numbers – Family Weekend Mode</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Monday:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Routine:</strong> Monday Manila Folder Check — place folders at tables; quick scan for unfinished/returned work; mark missing items in gradebook notes.</li>
          <li>Spiral Review Warm-Up: brief revisit of 1–2 key ideas from the prior week to strengthen retrieval.</li>
          <li>5 min – Warm-up: “same value” teaser: Show two different expressions equal to the same thing (e.g., 3(x+4) and 3x+12) and ask “Why are these equal?” Collect a few student guesses without naming properties.</li>
          <li>20–25 min – Discovery Task: Matching Equivalent Expressions — students get a set of expression cards; find matches and write in their own words why the match works. (No property names yet.) (Uses the expression-only half of a master card sort set; students will re-use this set with added property names/definitions on Tuesday.)</li>
          <li>10 min – Whole-class share: groups present matches and reasoning; teacher records student language for later linking to formal property names.</li>
          <li>5 min – Closure: Reflection prompt: “What’s one thing you noticed about how expressions can change but keep the same value?” Tape into notebook for later revisiting.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Tuesday:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>5 min – Warm-up (bridge to Monday): Project 2 pairs from Monday’s set. Prompt on slide: “How do you know these pairs are the same value? Describe the move in your own words (no names yet).” (Pair A: 3(x+4) → 3x+12; Pair B: (4·2)·6 → 4·(2·6))</li>
          <li>10 min – <strong>Name the moves</strong>: introduce commutative, associative, distributive, identity (0 and 1), and inverse properties with concise examples that match Monday’s puzzles.</li>
          <li>Post Success Criteria visibly: what mastery of each property looks like, with examples.</li>
          <li>10 min – <strong>Card Sort</strong>: Students use the full card sort set (expressions plus property names/definitions) to match each “move” to its property. Groups discuss and justify matches, using Monday’s language and new property names. Teacher circulates to prompt and clarify. Require a one‑line justification per match. Keep property names visible in a word bank for reference.</li>
          <li>15 min – <strong>Guided → Independent Practice with Group Support</strong>: Use the provided property practice sheet. In groups, each member must choose a different example if possible, complete it, then explain their reasoning aloud to the group. Rotate until all have shared. Teacher circulates to check accuracy and understanding. On the practice sheet, include a margin column for “Property” and “Because…” so students must pair the name with their reason.</li>
          <li>5 min – Bonus/extension: Groups create one original example for a property not in their set, swap with another group, and identify each other’s property.</li>
          <li><em>Reflection:</em> “When would naming the property help you communicate or check your work?”</li>
          <li>5 min – Logistics: launch DeltaMath #4 (Properties & Simplifying) — short set; open through next Friday.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Thursday (Family Weekend visitors likely):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>5–7 min – Warm-Up: “Spot the mistake” problem on board; pairs discuss and write which property was violated.</li>
          <li>10 min – Mini-Lesson: Model 2–3 step simplifications, pausing for students to name the property after each step. Include distributive + combining like terms + identity/inverse examples.</li>
          <li>15–18 min – Main Activity: Visitor-friendly paired challenge — solve 2–3 multi-step problems, labeling each step with the property name and a short “because” statement. Encourage color-coding property names.</li>
          <li>10 min – Error Analysis: Use simplification error analysis set. Small groups identify and correct each error, explaining which property misuse caused it.</li>
          <li><strong>Skill Points:</strong> During paired challenge/error analysis: Hint Card (2 SP) and Check‑One‑Step (1 SP) available.</li>
          <li>5 min – Wrap-Up/Reflection: “Which property did you use most today? Which one tripped you up?”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Friday (Family Weekend, possible altered schedule):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>5–7 min – Warm-Up: Error Analysis Mini-Set — 2–3 short simplification problems with deliberate mistakes. Students identify the error, name the violated property, and fix it.</li>
          <li>3–5 min – Mini-Intro to “Sell That Property” (Week 6 project): Explain that students will become “salespeople” for a math property next week. Show 1–2 fun analogy examples (e.g., Distributive = “the buy-one-get-one of math,” Identity = “an invisibility cloak for numbers”).</li>
          <li>15–20 min – Brainstorm Challenge: Students choose one property they like or understand best. Create a draft analogy, metaphor, slogan, or skit idea for that property. They can write, doodle, or sketch their idea.</li>
          <li>5–10 min – Quick Share-Out: A few volunteers share their analogy/slogan. Class discusses what made them memorable. Teacher records standout ideas to bring into Week 6.</li>
          <li>10–15 min – Housekeeping / Work Time: Complete DeltaMath #4, submit Weekly Notebook Check (Google Form), organize handouts, or catch up on missing work.</li>
          <li><strong>Skill Points:</strong> EARN +1 SP for DeltaMath catch‑up, +1 SP for notebook polish stamp. Light‑stakes SP week due to Family Weekend.</li>
          <li><em>Reflection:</em> “If you had to ‘sell’ one math property today, which would you pick and what’s your opening line?”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Additional Notes:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Homework and assessments lighter this week to accommodate Family Weekend schedules.</li>
          <li>Encourage <strong>verbal explanations</strong> and "because" statements; value the explanation over the label early in the week.</li>
          <li>Build <strong>informal familiarity before formal naming</strong> (Mon → Tue).</li>
          <li>Thread properties into earlier contexts (integers, rationals, fraction operations) to avoid feeling abstract.</li>
          <li>Include <strong>reflexive, symmetric, transitive</strong> in equation-justification puzzles so students see them as reasoning tools, not trivia.</li>
          <li>Keep groups stable through Week 5; plan reshuffle for Week 7 (new groups begin Monday of Week 7).</li>

        <li><strong>This is the culminating performance challenge for Module 0.</strong></li>
        <li>
          <strong>Group Challenge: Properties Relay</strong><br>
          In your group, you’ll receive a set of multi-step expressions. As a team, simplify each expression step by step. For every step, you must:
          <ul>
            <li>Write the property used (e.g., Distributive, Associative, Identity, Inverse, etc.)</li>
            <li>Justify your move in a short sentence (“Because…”)</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>SP options (Group):</strong> One total Hint Card (2 SP) and Check‑One‑Step (1 SP) per team. No time purchases; unfinished items move to office hours/retake flow.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Individual Challenge: Property Justification & Error Analysis</strong><br>
          Each student will receive 2–3 short problems:
          <ul>
            <li>One requires identifying and naming the property used in a given step.</li>
            <li>One asks you to spot and correct a property mistake in a simplification (error analysis).</li>
            <li>One “explain your thinking” prompt: “Why is the distributive property sometimes called the ‘unpacking’ property? Give an example.”</li>
            <li>SP options (Individual): Swap‑One (2 SP) for one problem; no Notes Peek.</li>
          </ul>
          Show your work and explanations clearly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Reflection:</em> “What’s one property or simplification step you feel most confident in now, and why?”<br>
          <strong>Housekeeping:</strong> Submit Weekly Notebook Check (Google Form), finish any DeltaMath (#4), organize handouts, preview next unit.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Retake Path:</strong> Students below threshold complete DeltaMath review + corrections by Wednesday to unlock a retake in office hours. Office hours visit earns +1 SP toward next assessment.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><em>Additional Notes:</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Tuesday’s task to merge creativity with precision; require math examples to reinforce property meaning.</li>
        <li>Thursday serves as both wrap-up and extra practice before Friday’s assessment.</li>

  <h2>Week 8 (Oct 20–24): How to Use Spreadsheets — IM Unit 1 Section C</h2>
  <p><em>Section C Goals:</em> Use a spreadsheet as a tool for calculating values quickly; create basic formulas; interpret results. Assume zero prior experience. (Optional sequence; no IM checkpoint.)</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monday — Lesson 6: Mystery Computations (Optional)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Routine:</strong> Monday Manila Folder Check — place folders at tables; quick scan for unfinished/returned work; mark missing items in gradebook notes.</li>
        <li>5 min – Warm‑up (Algebra ↔ Spreadsheet bridge):
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Q1 (tip expression):</strong> Ariana leaves a 32% tip on a bill of <em>d</em> dollars. Write an algebraic expression for the total cost (dinner + tip). Then write the spreadsheet formula you would type. <em>(Expected: 1.32d; in a cell: =d_cell*(1+0.32))</em></li>
            <li><strong>Q2 (percent decrease):</strong> The number 20 decreases to 19. What percent decrease is that (nearest tenth)? How would a spreadsheet compute it from two cells old and new? <em>(Expected: 5.0%; formula: =(old-new)/old)</em></li>
            <li><em>Teacher move:</em> 60‑second share‑out: 2–3 students read the algebra, then 2–3 read the spreadsheet formula; stress equivalence.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>15 min – Orientation to the grid: cells, addresses, = sign, constants vs references. <strong>Require one absolute reference</strong> example (e.g., <code>=$B$2*A3</code>) and explain why it’s locked.</li>
        <li>18 min – Mystery operations in a toy sheet; students change inputs, observe outputs, and conjecture the rule. Plant one intentional bug (e.g., tax applied to MSRP instead of discounted price) for pairs to find and fix.</li>
        <li>2 min – Create a <strong>Sanity‑Check cell</strong>: an estimate range; it flags red if outside expected bounds.</li>
        <li>5 min – Reflection: “How can you tell if a cell is a formula or a fixed value—and when should you lock a reference?”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tuesday — Lesson 7: Spreadsheet Computations (Optional)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>5 min – Warm‑up: evaluate a short chain of referenced cells by hand first.</li>
        <li>12 min – Build & compute: =A1+B1, copy down, <strong>absolute vs relative refs</strong> (lock one). % formatting; currency formatting.</li>
        <li>10 min – Add a <strong>Sanity‑Check cell</strong> that compares a hand‑estimate to computed value (conditional format if off by &gt;5%).</li>
        <li>10 min – Error‑hunt mini: fix ####, #VALUE!, and a wrong‑base tax bug.</li>
        <li>3 min – Exit: “When would you lock a reference?”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Thursday — Lesson 8: Spreadsheet Shortcuts (Optional)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>5 min – Warm‑up: pattern fill; recognize a simple recursion.</li>
        <li>15 min – Shortcuts: fill handle, autofill series, simple recursive formulas.</li>
        <li>20 min – Mini challenge: model a running total or depreciation with a single formula copied down.</li>
        <li>5 min – Exit: “What shortcut reduced your clicks the most today?”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Friday — Assessment: Conversion Challenge (Recreate Your Paper)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>30–35 min – <strong>Assessment build</strong>: Using only the provided template and your <em>paper</em> Car‑Buying Percent Challenge, recreate the out‑the‑door calculator. <u>Requirements:</u> inputs area; formulas must use cell references; correct currency/% formats; one “sanity‑check” cell.</li>
        <li>3 min – Mini prompt on the slide: “Write your tip line two ways: algebra (e.g., 1.32d) and spreadsheet (e.g., =B4*(1+0.32)). Why are they the same?”</li>
        <li>10 min – Peer debug swap; submit link for feedback.</li>
        <li>5 min – Logistics: light DeltaMath (optional review) and Weekly Notebook Check.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Notes:</em>
      <ul>
